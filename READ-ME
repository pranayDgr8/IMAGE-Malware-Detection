We propose a simple yet effective method for visualizing and classifying malware using image processing techniques.
Malware binaries are visualized as gray-scale images, with the observation that for many malware families, the images belonging to the same family 
appear very similar in layout and texture. Motivated by this visual similarity, a classification method using standard image features is proposed. 
Neither disassembly nor code execution is required for classification.
Preliminary experimental results are quite promising with CNN and transfer learning classification accuracy on a malware database of 9,339 samples
with 25 different malware families.
